The main Opus App website is located <a href="http://opusapp.ml"> here. </a>

## Feature List Opus Version: 4.0

1. _Adding_ notes.
2. _Adding_ notes with your _voice_.
3. _Editing_ notes.
4. _Checking_ and _Archiving_.
5. _Settings_ info.

## Instructions

### 1.  _Adding_ notes:

To add a note tap on the big orange ***Add*** button. This will make a new section appear where you can add a title and a note. When you are done filling out the text simply tap the green ***Save*** button. To cancel adding mode tap on the red ***Cancel*** button.

### 2. _Adding_ notes with your _voice_:

If you want to add a note in a rush you can add it with 2 taps and your voice, here is how:
Hold in the big orange ***Add*** button and the phone will tell you that voice mode is activated. First add a title, after speaking out the title stay quiet for a few seconds and the app will continue to adding the note text. To save tap the green ***Save*** buttton, and to cancel tap on the red ***Cancel*** button. (In future updates you will be able to save the note handsfree too.) 

### 3. _Editing_ notes:

To edit a saved note tap the orange ***My Notes*** button and a list with your notes titles will pop up (to go back tap your phones 'back' button). To open a note tap on it and it will first show up in a read only mode, but to edit it tap on the ***Edit*** button. When you are done editing tap the green ***Save*** button. To cancel tap the red ***Cancel*** button.

### 4. _Checking_ and _archiving_:

In opus you can't delete a note just archive and overwrite it. _Archiving_ and _Checking_ is basically the same thing. Say you have created a note called 'Buy milk' after you have completed the task (in this case to buy milk) open the note from ***My notes*** and tap ***Check*** to mark the note or task as done and move it from _My Notes_ to the _Archive_ (Which you can access by tapping on the orange ***Archive*** button on the top of the screen). You can also check the note from editing mode ;) ***Warning! The archive only stores the lastly checked note which means if you have a note archived and check another one the old note will be overwritten by the new one and it will be lost!*** If you want to restore an archived note just tap on 'Archive', tap on the note you want to restore, a new UI area will pop up with the actions 'Restore' and 'Cancel'. To restore tap 'Restore' and the note will be removed from the archive and moved to 'My Notes'.

### 5. _Settings_ Info

To access the settings tap on the orange ***Settigns*** button and the settings options will pop up. The settings includes the following options (at least for now):
- Open _My Notes_ on startup
- Reset the app's stored files (saved notes)

_Open My Notes On Startup_:

If the option is set to ***ON*** every time you open the app it will automatically open _My Notes_, but if it is set to ***OFF*** the app will work normally and you will have to manually open _My Notes_ by tapping ***My Notes*** (see point nr: 3's start).

_Reset the app's stored files_ <br>
If you tap this button a warning will show up and warn you, but to reset you will have to hold in the red ***Reset*** button. 
## ***Warning! By resetting you will delete all your notes and they will be lost forever!***
