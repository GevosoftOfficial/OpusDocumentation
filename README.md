### 4. _Checking_ and _archiving_:

In opus you cant delete a note just archive and overwrite it. _Archiving_ and _Checking_ is basicly the same thing. Say you have created a note called 'Buy milk' after you have completed the task (i nthis case to buy milk) open the note from ***My notes** click ***Edit*** and ***Check*** to mark the note or task as done and remove it from _My Notes_ and add it to _Archive_ (Witch you can acces by clicking on the oragne _Archive_ button on the top of the screen). ***Warning!

- Open _My Notes_ on startup
