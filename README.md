## Instructions

### 1.  _Adding_ notes:

To add a note click on the big oragne ***Add*** button. This will make a new section apear where you can add a title and a note. When you are done filling out the text simply click the green ***Save*** button. To cancel adding mode click on the red ***Cancel*** Button.

### 2. _Adding_ notes with your _voice_:

If you want to add a note in a rush you can add it with 2 taps and your voice, here is how:
Longclick the big organe ***Add*** button and the phone will tell you that voice mode is activated. First add a title, after speaking out the title stay quiet for a few seconds and the app will continue to adding the note text. To save click the green ***Save*** buttton. And to cancel the red ***Cancel*** button. (In future updates you will be able to save the note handsfree too.) 

### 3. _Editing_ notes:

To edit a saved note click the oragne ***My Notes*** button and a list with your notes titles will pop up (To go back tap your phones 'back' button). To oen a note click on it and it will first show up in a read only mode, but to edit it click on the ***Edit*** button. When you are done editing click the green ***Save*** button. To cancel click the red ***Cancel*** button.

### 4. _Checking_ and _archiving_:

In opus you can't delete a note just archive and overwrite it. _Archiving_ and _Checking_ is basicly the same thing. Say you have created a note called 'Buy milk' after you have completed the task (in this case to buy milk) open the note from ***My notes*** click ***Edit*** and ***Check*** to mark the note or task as done and move it from _My Notes_ to the _Archive_ (Witch you can acces by clicking on the oragne ***Archive*** button on the top of the screen). ***Warning! By adding a note to the archive list you can't get it back and it will only stay in the archive until you archive another note, the archive only stores the lastly archived/checked note!***

### 5. _Settings_ Info

To acces the settings click on the oragne ***Settigns*** Button and the settings options will pop up. The settings includes the following options (at least for now):
- Open _My Notes_ on startup
- Reset the apps stored files (saved notes)

_Oppen My Notes On Startup_:

If the option is set to ***ON*** every time you open the app it will automaticly open _My Notes_, But if it is set to ***OFF*** the app will work normaly and you will have to manualy open _My Notes_ by clicking ***My Notes*** (see point nr: 3's start)

_Reset the apps stored files_ <br>
If you click this button a warning will show up and warn you, but to reset you will have to long click the red ***Reset*** button. 
## ***Warning! By resetting you will delet all your notes and they will be lost forever!***
